I am a fifth year JD-PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University (advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/">Chris RÃ©</a>). I'm a part of the <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/">Hazy Research Lab</a>, <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/">Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models</a>, and <a href="https://reglab.stanford.edu/">RegLab</a>. I graduated with a MS in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University ('19) and a BS (with Honors) in Computer Science from Stanford University ('18). I am grateful to be supported by the <a href="https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf">Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship (SIGF)</a> and the <a href= "https://hai.stanford.edu/fellows">HAI Graduate Fellowship</a>. 


My research is on the intersection of AI and law. I'm interested in the following questions: 

- **What types of legal reasoning tasks can LLMs perform well?** Towards this goal I've worked on developing a range of benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on legal reasoning/legal data: [LegalBench](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/legalbench/), [CaseHOLD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08671), [LoCo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07440). We have several more benchmarks in the pipeline!
- **How can we improve LLM performance without labeled data or human-supervision?** I'm interested in how auxiliary information (e.g., embeddings) can be useful here ([Smoothie](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pPSWHsgqRp), [Embroid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11031), [Bootleg](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper13.pdf)).
- **Can we use machine learning to better understand the law and legal institutions?** A major bottleneck in empirical legal research is the cost/time required for manual coding. I'm excited about how machine learning can help us construct large scale datasets cheaply and quickly. Some of my recent work in this area explores [measuring private enforcement in the states](https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol172/iss1/2/), and building [annotated database of state statutes](./assets/pdf/state_statutes_db.pdf).
- **How should we govern AI?** For instance, I've written about how [courts might assess liability for medical AI](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhle2308901?query=featured_home), and the [technical/institutional tradeoffs](https://dho.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/AI_Regulation.pdf) raised by different traditional regulatory interventions (e.g., disclosure, licensing, etc.).
