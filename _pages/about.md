I am a final year PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by [Chris R&eacute;](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/). My research explores different topics in the intersection of AI and law. I have published across a range of venues, including ML conferences (ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR), law reviews (UPenn, Wisconsin, GW, Harvard JOLT), medical journals (NEJM, JAMA), and interdisciplinary computational legal venues (CS&Law, ICAIL).

I am affiliated with the [Hazy Research Lab](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/), the [RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu/), and the [LIFTLab](https://liftlab.stanford.edu/). I am grateful to be supported by the [Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship (SIGF)](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf) and the [HAI Graduate Fellowship](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/stanford-hai-welcomes-graduate-postdoc-fellows). I hold a JD from Stanford Law, a MS in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University, and a BSH in Computer Science from Stanford University.
