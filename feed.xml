I had to set it up on Stanford’s network (<em>loud boos</em>). Since the top result for when you search “stanford xbox set up” is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/stomvs/how_do_i_connect_xbox_series_x_to_wifi/">Reddit post</a> from almost four years ago (with no definitive answer), I thought I’d write up my experience.</p>

<p>To get the Xbox on the network, you need to register it with Stanford. Go <a href="https://rnt.stanford.edu/">here</a> and click on “Browserless Devices”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plug in the Xbox to a display and a power source.</li>
  <li>Set up a hotspot on your phone.</li>
  <li>Take out the controller, put the batteries in, and turn it on.</li>
  <li>Press the menu button on the controller (the button with the three lines).</li>
  <li>Walk through the setup process, and connect to the hotspot.</li>
  <li>It will probably ask you to download an update. Godspeed. Mine was 1.6GB and on my iphone hotspot took a while (started at 6:45pm, finished at 7pm).</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions on the screen to turn on the console using the controller.</li>
  <li>Sign into your Xbox account.</li>
  <li>Go to Settings &gt; Network &gt; Network Settings &gt; Advanced Settings. Find the wireless MAC address.</li>
  <li>On a laptop, go to <a href="https://rnt.stanford.edu/">Stanford’s network registration page</a> and click on “Browserless Devices”. At some point you’ll be asked to enter the MAC address. You might then get a message about how long you need to wait.</li>
  <li>On the Xbox, change the network to Stanford, and you should be all good to go!</li>
